					<h2 class="parallh2">Autumn</h2>
					<p h2 class="parallp">An under-appreciated season in Scandinavia, autumn will charm you with crisp, clean air and colourful leaves. Knowing that winter will descend soon, Scandinavians enjoy the season to the fullest, particularly all the delicious seasonal foods that emerge at this time, such as crab in Norway and apples in Denmark. Though it’s usually quite chilly by late October, September can often have a late-summer vibe that’s made all the better by being bathed in golden autumn light.However, there is a little-known secret to autumn in Scandinavia; it's actually one of the best times to spot the Northern Lights.  It's perfect for those looking to avoid those winter chills, while enjoying the brilliance of autumn's colours and  that oh-so Scandinavian of activities – foraging.</p>

					<h2 class="parallh2">Winter</h2>
					<p h2 class="parallp">Sure, it’s going to be cold. I mean, really cold. But if you can cope with it, winter travel in Scandinavia has some incredible benefits. Foremost is that you’ll get your best chance to see the Northern Lights. Though they can be viewed in many places between September and March, the best time is winter due to the extremely short, dry days.Other winter activities include sports like cross-country skiing, snowmobiling ice fishing. Throughout the month of December, Christmas markets and decoration bring a festive atmosphere to all the Scandinavian countries.</p>

					<h2 class="parallh2">Spring</h2>
					<p h2 class="parallp">Spring is a lovely time to visit Scandinavia for its lush greenery, longer days and crisp air. If you’re expecting consistent sunny or warm weather, though, you can pretty much forget about it. It will not be warm, but it will get lighter than winter quite quickly.Unlike during the summer, there are fewer tourists around and you’ll likely get a few glorious days(particularly in the south in May, in Denmark and southern Sweden). You may also get some cold and rainy ones, so spring in Scandinavia is a time to be prepared for any kind of weather.</p>
